= prs â€“ Tool for parallel reversal schedules

This tool generates and analyzes parallel reversal schedules.
It has been developed along with the diploma thesis

https://njh.eu/prs[Parallel reversal schedules using more checkpoints than processors]

to support the research.
Most of what is formally described there,
such as the profile algebra,
is also implemented within this tool.
Almost all schedule pictures and profiles of the thesis
have been automatically generated by this tool.
Also, the exhaustive search
is implemented here.

The correctness of this program
is secured by
OCaml's strict ML typesystem
combined with
a comprehensive set of unit tests.
This allowed for fast refactoring,
which enabled this tool
to be developed
simultaneously
with the thesis,
influencing each other.

== Usage

If `prs` is called without any arguments,
the list of commands is shown:

....
Usage:
prs s PROCESSES RESOURCES
prs sp PROCESSES RESOURCES
prs gen PROCESSES RESOURCES
prs tree TREE
prs tree_letters TREE
prs tree_search MAX_PROCESSES MAX_RESOURCES MAX_REACH
prs old_tree_search PROCESSES MAX_RESOURCES
prs ascii < PRIME_SCHEDULE
prs ascii_small < PRIME_SCHEDULE
prs fibers FIBERS
prs lp PROCESSES REACH
prs search MAX_PROCESSES MAX_RESOURCES
prs latex_tree TREE
prs latex_gen PROCESSES RESOURCES
prs latex_ps < PRIME_SCHEDULE
prs test
....

The command `prs{nbsp}test` runs all unit tests.
`prs{nbsp}search` runs the exhaustive search
as described in{nbsp}https://njh.eu/prs.pdf#page=58[Section 4.2].
`prs{nbsp}gen`
generates the optimal respectively suboptimal schedules
as defined in{nbsp}https://njh.eu/prs.pdf#page=56[Chapter 4].
The commands `prs{nbsp}s` and `prs{nbsp}sp`
also generate those schedules,
but have a less verbose output.
Arbitrary binary-decomposable schedules can be analyzed with `prs{nbsp}tree`.

For example,
`prs{nbsp}gen{nbsp}3{nbsp}6` generates the optimal schedule for _p=3,k=6_,
draws it in ASCII{nbsp}art,
shows the tree structure (where `e` means &#x3b5;)
and shows the profiles (where `-1@23` means{nbsp}-&#x3c6;~23~).
Note that the ASCII art schedules are rotated by{nbsp}-90{deg}.
